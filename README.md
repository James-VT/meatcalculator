Serious note: Food safety is your responsibility. This calculator was built for educational purposes and for the joy of code, not for any guarantee of culinary standards. I am not an expert in food preparation. My sources are scattered across the web and might be out of date. Final responsibility for the meat actually being cooked safely sits with you.
